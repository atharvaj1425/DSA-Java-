# Sliding Window & Subarray/Substr Cheat Sheet

This is a quick reference guide for identifying the correct approach for various subarray and substring problems. Problems are categorized by goal (e.g., max length, count of subarrays) and solution strategy (sliding window, prefix sum + hashmap, etc.).

### Utility Functions/Patterns

#### `atMost(nums, k)`

```java
int atMost(int[] nums, int k) {
    int l = 0, res = 0;
    for (int r = 0; r < nums.length; r++) {
        if (nums[r] % 2 == 1) k--;
        while (k < 0) {
            if (nums[l] % 2 == 1) k++;
            l++;
        }
        res += r - l + 1;
    }
    return res;
}
```

Then:

```java
numberOfSubarrays = atMost(nums, k) - atMost(nums, k - 1);
```

# ðŸ§± Patterns Summary

- **Sliding Window** works well with **non-negative numbers** and **growing/shrinking windows**.
- **Prefix Sum + HashMap** is needed when values can be **negative** or **exact sums** are required.
- **`atMost(k) - atMost(k-1)`** is a great trick when counting subarrays with **exact constraints**.
- **Character frequency** problems (like replacements or unique substrings) benefit from **maps or arrays** for frequency tracking.

### Notes:

* Use **sliding window** when elements are non-negative and you can **shrink/grow** the window easily.
* Use **prefix sum + hashmap** when the array contains **negative numbers** or the window cannot be shrunk easily.
* For **exact count of subarrays**, `atMost(k) - atMost(k-1)` pattern works well.
* **Character replacement** problems generally track **max frequency** of a character in a window.

* Count subarrays with bounded maximum
* Minimum window substring (harder)
