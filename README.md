# üöÄ DSA Pattern-Based Resource Repository

Welcome to the **DSA Pattern-Based Resource Repository**!  
This collection is designed to help you master Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) for interviews, placements, and competitive programming.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Pattern Cheat Sheets:**  
  - [patterns_in_dsa.md](patterns_in_dsa.md): Quick reference for common DSA patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Prefix Sum, etc.) and when to use them.
  - [Subarrays_Substrings_pattern.md](Subarrays_Substrings_pattern.md): Subarray and substring problem-solving strategies, including sliding window and prefix sum tricks.
  - [ConstraintsPattern.md](ConstraintsPattern.md): Table for choosing approaches based on input constraints.

- **Topic-wise Java Solutions:**  
  - **Arrays/**: Problems like subarray sums, sliding window, two pointers, majority element, and more.
  - **Strings/**: String manipulation, substring problems, compression, and pattern matching.
  - **LinkedLists/**: Classic linked list operations, cycle detection, reversal, and intersection.

- **Placement & Interview Resources:**  
  - [DSA-Placement-Resources.md](DSA-Placement-Resources.md): Curated links to top DSA sheets, playlists, and company-wise practice sets.

- **Step-by-Step Explanations:**  
  - [how count subarrays work.txt](how%20count%20subarrays%20work.txt): Dry-run and explanation of prefix sum + hashmap for subarray counting.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Browse Cheat Sheets:**  
   Start with the markdown files for pattern recognition and approach selection.

2. **Practice Problems:**  
   Dive into the `Arrays/`, `Strings/`, and `LinkedLists/` folders for Java solutions. Try to solve problems yourself, then compare with provided solutions.

3. **Placement Prep:**  
   Use the resource guide to plan your revision and practice schedule.

4. **Learn by Example:**  
   Refer to step-by-step dry runs and explanations for tricky concepts.
